* Open questions
** Semantics of import modes
"use" and "extend" were clear in the absence of overloading. They are not any more. In the current implementation they are equivalent.
** Special sort "Any"
This causes lots of special cases. Perhaps it should not be exposed (reserved for builtin modules) and handled with less generality and less checking.
** Domains for division
What should the range sort of (/ 1 0) be?
** Sorts in equations
In Maude, left and right hand side must be of the same kind. In OBJ3, the right-hans side must be of lower sort.
*** Illustration (legal in Maude, but not in OBJ3)
fmod ABCD is
  sorts A B C D .
  subsort A C < B .
  subsort C < D .
  op a : -> A .
  op b : -> B .
  op c : -> C .
  op d : -> D .
  op foo : A -> A .
  eq a = b .
  eq b = c .
  eq c = d .
endfm

reduce in ABCD : foo(a) .
rewrites: 3
result [D,B]: foo(d)
