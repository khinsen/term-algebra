Order-sorted term-algebras for computational science
====================================================

This repository contains an experiment with
[order-sorted term algebras](http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~fleck/181content/osa1.pdf)
for use as a
[formal language for expressing scientific models](http://beta.briefideas.org/ideas/27deb8bb6d86c83d29f53320f02a22a5).

Note that this is an Open Science research project, *not* production-quality software. Everything can change overnight without warning. I even do destructive pushes occasionally. If this ever turns into something usable, I will clean up the code and write documentation.

If you have questions about this, please contact me by e-mail.
