* Open questions
** Semantics of import modes
"use" and "extend" were clear in the absence of overloading. They are not any more. In the current implementation they are equivalent.
** Overloaded var-arity ops
Every var-arity op can be used as a nullary op. No arguments means no overloading: the nullary op must have a unique range sort.
The current implementation allows an explicit nullary definition *before* any number of overloaded var-ary ones. It also allows a non-overloaded var-ary definition. Anything else leads to a failed preregularity check.
