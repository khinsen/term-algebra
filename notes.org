* Open questions
** Semantics of import modes
"use" and "extend" were clear in the absence of overloading. They are not any more. In the current implementation they are equivalent.
** Special sort "Any"
This causes lots of special cases. Perhaps it should not be exposed (reserved for builtin modules) and handled with less generality and less checking.
** Domains for division
What should the range sort of (/ 1 0) be?
