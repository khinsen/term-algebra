============

This branch documents an initial attempt at defining modules as Racket
modules, using a #lang definition. Operators are bound to Racket
identifiers. This works withing the Racket universe, and was a good
way to get started. Since one of the major goals of the project is
to transform modules dynamically, and to publish and retrieve
modules from digital repositories, this approach is too static.
